# WeatherApp
Simple app to improve my API learning :)
##
There is a simple application that provides you information about temperature, pressure and wind speed of countries or cities that you type in 'digite aqui'.
I used some CSS knowledges about variables, flexbox etc.
##
This was quick to code but I forced myself to study and apply learning about API's and how it works. I finally got it, and could call that API many times 
as I wanted and creating more spans (see commit 5880f2a).
